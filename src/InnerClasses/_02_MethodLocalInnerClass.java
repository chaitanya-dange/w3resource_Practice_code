/*
Sometimes we can declare a class inside a method such type of inner classes are called method local inner classes.

The main objective of method local inner class is to define method specific repeatedly required functionality.

Method Local inner classes are best suitable to meet nested method requirement.

We can access method local inner class only within the method where we declared it.
That is from outside of the method we can't access. As the scope of method local inner classes is very less,
this type of inner classes are most rarely used type of inner classes.
