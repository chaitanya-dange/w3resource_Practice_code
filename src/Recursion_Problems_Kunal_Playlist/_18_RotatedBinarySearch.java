/*

 here's an example of a 10-element array and some of its rotated arrays:

Original array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Rotated by 1: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1]   from 1 the array is rotated

Rotated by 3: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3]       from 3 the array is rotated

Rotated by 6: [7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]       from 6 the array is rotated

Rotated by 9: [10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]       from 9 the array is rotated

Note that a rotation by the length of the array results in the original array.
